# Development

### npm install -g expo-cli

### npm start

By using expo, time to development startup is insanely quick. Only caveat is it's not possible to include custom native modules beyond the React Native APIs and components that are available in the Expo client app.

However we can eject and follow the docs to incorporate iOS/Android code as necessary.
